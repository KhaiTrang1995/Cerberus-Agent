/**
 * The lifecycle of a triage run, shared by the five internal routes.
 *
 * A triage run used to exist only in the agent's memory. Nothing else in the
 * product could see one, so version activation, version save, the delta
 * preview, project import and project delete could all swap or delete the graph
 * while a run was halfway through reading it — and then the run would publish
 * its results onto a graph that no longer matched.
 *
 * `TriageRun` makes the run a row. Three rules follow from that:
 *
 * 1. **The agent authorises before it works.** The run is created through an
 *    internal route that re-checks ownership STRICTLY, ignoring the log-only
 *    `ACCESS_ENFORCE=0` mode, so a ticket minted in observe-mode cannot start a
 *    run on somebody else's project.
 * 2. **A stale heartbeat stops blocking.** A crashed agent must not hold a
 *    project forever, so a run that has not checked in for ten minutes no
 *    longer counts as live, and the next create marks it failed.
 * 3. **Publishing is a conditional transition.** `running -> publishing` uses
 *    the same atomic `updateMany` pattern as the activation lock, so a run that
 *    lost its claim writes nothing at all rather than writing half of it.
