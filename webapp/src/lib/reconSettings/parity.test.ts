/**
 * P1: the UI and MCP reach the same things.
 *
 * "Identical capabilities" was false in BOTH directions before this. MCP could
 * write 65 columns the form had no input for, which is the direction nobody
 * notices because the missing half is the one a person would have complained
 * about. And the engagement's limits were reachable only through a dedicated
 * MCP tool with its own direction rules, which is the direction that made the
 * form look safer than it was.
 *
 * Two assertions, and they are deliberately opposite:
 *
 *   every WRITABLE field has an input      MCP cannot reach what the form cannot
 *   every INPUT is a writable field        the form cannot reach what MCP cannot,
 *                                          except the engagement RECORD, which is
 *                                          UI-only on purpose and named as such
 *
 * This is what stops the gap reopening the next time a tool ships with MCP
 * support and no UI, which is exactly how the sixteen TruffleHog options
 * happened: the per-source targets moved to their own model, the shared ones
 * stayed on Project, and nothing noticed for a year.
