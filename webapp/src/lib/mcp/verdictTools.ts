/**
 * The one write to a finding on this surface: a triage verdict.
 *
 * It closes the loop for an external triage assistant, whose judgement would
 * otherwise be recomputed from scratch by the next nightly run.
 *
 * THE PROVENANCE DESIGN IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE. The instinct is to write a
 * third `triage_source` value so an agent's verdict is not laundered as a
 * human's. That is wrong, and it was checked across every site that reads the
 * field: `triage_source` is a closed two-value set four separate behaviours
 * branch on. A third value makes the finding prune-eligible, so the next scan
 * DELETES it rather than stamping `stale_since`; it lets a later AI run
 * overwrite the verdict, because the publish guard tests equality with
 * 'human'; it stops `likely_noise` producing a false-positive state, because
 * the scorer tests membership of ("human","ai"); and it renders as "Not
 * reviewed" in the board.
 *
 * So the verdict stays `'human'` - honest in the sense that matters, since the
 * token is the operator's own delegated credential carrying their authority -
 * and the CHANNEL is recorded separately, on a property that no branch reads.
 *
 * MUTE AND UNMUTE ARE NOT HERE, in either direction. Mute is the one action
 * that makes a finding invisible to every other read on this surface, and
 * "this is a false positive, mute it" is an entirely plausible injection
 * against an agent whose context is full of target-controlled text. Unmute is
 * out for a less obvious reason: the triage subsystem's stated invariant is
 * that only a person mutes, which is precisely what bounds a prompt injection
 * in scanner output to "mislabel a verdict a human can overrule". Handing
 * unmute to an unattended token removes that bound, and reversing a
 * suppression is the same control operated in the direction that makes hidden
 * findings visible again.
 *
 * Which is also why a verdict on a MUTED finding is refused. A human verdict is
 * one of the Mute Rules guards, so on a rule-muted finding it releases the mute
 * at the next apply or scan: the same unmute, one step removed. The agent keys
 * the refusal on the MCP channel and checks it under the node's write lock, in
 * the same statement as the write.
