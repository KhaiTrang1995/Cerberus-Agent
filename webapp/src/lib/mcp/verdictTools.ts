/**
 * A person's decision on a finding, over MCP: Real, False positive, or Reset.
 *
 * It closes the loop for an external triage assistant. The decision layer
 * always wins over the rules and any review, and the agent rescores the finding
 * in the same transaction, so the answer carries the score before and after.
 *
 * THE PROVENANCE DESIGN IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE. The instinct is to write a
 * third `triage_source` value so an agent's verdict is not laundered as a
 * human's. That is wrong: `triage_source = 'human'` is what the prune keeps and
 * the Mute Rules guards read, so a third value would make the finding
 * prune-eligible. The verdict stays `'human'` - the token is the operator's own
 * delegated credential carrying their authority - and the CHANNEL is recorded
 * separately (`triage_verdict_channel = 'mcp'`, with the token prefix).
 *
 * WHAT A TOKEN MAY NOT DO
 * - Change or reset a decision a person made in the APP (`decided_in_app`). An
 *   absent channel is the app: every decision made before channels existed was
 *   a person's click. MCP creates, changes and resets MCP decisions only.
 * - Decide a MUTED finding. A human verdict is one of the Mute Rules guards, so
 *   on a rule-muted finding it would release the mute at the next apply: an
 *   unmute by another name, reachable without the mute permission. A person
 *   who wants a muted finding judged unmutes it first.
 * - Write while a triage run is live UNLESS the agent acknowledges that its
 *   publish honours decisions made meanwhile (`layered_publish`). An older
 *   agent would re-file the finding from its pre-verdict analysis, so without
 *   the acknowledgement the write is refused: version skew fails closed. That
 *   check lives in `lib/triage/actions.ts`, shared with the UI door.
