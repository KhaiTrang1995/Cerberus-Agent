/**
 * Error normalisation for the inbound MCP surface.
 *
 * A stable, safe message leaves the process; the full detail goes to the server
 * log. The project already has the counter-pattern in
 * `normalizeOrchestratorStartError` ("never render the raw object"), and this
 * applies the same rule to every MCP response: no stack traces, no file paths,
 * no Cypher or schema fragments, no upstream body passed through.
 *
 * Why it matters more here than in the UI: the caller is an external agent that
 * will put whatever it receives into a model's context. An upstream error
 * carrying a hostname, a provider message or a Cypher fragment becomes training
 * data for the next prompt, and a leaked internal path becomes reconnaissance.
