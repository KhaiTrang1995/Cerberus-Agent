 * envelope it never wanted, and it inherits `agentFetch`'s 30s default instead
 * of setting its own bound. Same shape as `graphClient.ts` instead: a direct
 * fetch with the internal key, an explicit timeout, and either parsed data or
 * an `McpToolError`.
 *
 * Every call sets `source: 'mcp'`. That is not decoration: it is what opts the
 * request into the agent's MCP concurrency ceiling. Without it these tools run
 * unthrottled against the same Neo4j the operator's own Priority Board reads
 * through this very endpoint.
