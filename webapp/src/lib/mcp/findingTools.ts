/**
 * What the scans actually found.
 *
 * The single biggest gap in the shipped surface. The only route to a finding
 * was `query_graph`, which forces an external agent to already know that "a
 * finding" means one of eight unrelated labels, and then to invent its own
 * ranking. The product computes a ranking and the surface threw it away.
 *
 * Two things here are not obvious and are both load-bearing:
 *
 *  - a project that has never been triaged has NO ranking, and that is the
 *    common case. Saying "ranked by priority" over a list of nulls would make a
 *    caller either trust an order that carries no signal or read unscored as
 *    unimportant, so `triageState` says which of the two worlds it is in.
 *  - muted findings are excluded here, from `graph_summary`, and from Cypher
 *    (the tenant filter refuses any query naming the label). So "zero findings"
 *    can mean "a human suppressed thirty criticals", which is why
 *    `list_muted_findings` exists at all.
