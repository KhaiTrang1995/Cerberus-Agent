/**
 * The one Triage button, in all three places it appears.
 *
 * There used to be three buttons sending the same message under two different
 * names — "Rank Findings" on the Priority Board, "Start Vulnerability Triage"
 * and "Re-triage" on CypherFix — and only one of them asked for confirmation.
 * They ran the same job, so an operator could press one, see the other page
 * change, and have no idea the two were connected.
 *
 * One component, one label, one dialog.
 *
 * WHY THE DIALOG IS LONG. A triage run is not free and not invisible: it spends
 * LLM budget, replaces the board's order, rewrites the fix list, and blocks
 * version activation while it works. Every one of those is something an
 * operator would reasonably be annoyed to discover afterwards, so the dialog
 * says all of it with THIS project's numbers in it. The numbers come from
 * /api/triage/preflight, which is why the dialog is fetched rather than static.

          gets a 0-100 score from the facts in the graph: how likely it is to be
          real, how likely it is to be exploited, how bad it would be, and how
          reachable it is. No AI in this step.
        </li>

              the evidence behind each score: the request and response, the file

              likely it is to be real or how bad it would be, dispute a fact the
              evidence contradicts, or mark it as a likely false positive. Every
              quote it gives is checked, and the score is recalculated by the same
              rules. Up to {pre.reviewBudget} findings are reviewed (this project&apos;s
              review budget); a finding whose evidence has not changed since its last
              review keeps that review and costs nothing.
