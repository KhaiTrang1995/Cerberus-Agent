/**
 * The Priority Board: what to fix first, and who decided it.
 *
 * Every finding carries three layers: the rules' score from a run, a review
 * (the built-in AI during a run, or an external agent over MCP) and a person's
 * decision. The server combines them into the one final score the board ranks
 * by. Each row names the layer that decided it and how far that moved the
 * rules' score; the detail panel shows why.
 *
 * This is the working set an operator is triaging. What they decided to stop
 * looking at lives in its own table, Muted Nodes (All Nodes dropdown), which is
 * the ONLY place in the product where a suppressed finding is visible at all.
 * Everything else -- the graph, the agent, analytics, reports -- has them
 * filtered out, which is the point of the feature. It is paged there because a
 * node-filter rule can mute thousands of findings, and this board used to load
 * every muted row on each visit.
 *
 * The mute itself is `useMuteNode`, shared with the node drawer and the graph
 * tables so every Mute button behaves the same.
