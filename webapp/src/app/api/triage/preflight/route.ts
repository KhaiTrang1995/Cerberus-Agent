/**
 * GET /api/triage/preflight?projectId= — what the confirm dialog needs to say.
 *
 * The dialog exists because a triage run is not free and not invisible: it
 * spends LLM budget, replaces the board's order, rewrites the fix list, and
 * blocks version activation while it works. An operator should be told all of
 * that with THIS project's numbers in it, not with a generic warning.
 *
 * So this answers four questions in one call:
 *   how much is in scope, and how much of it is new since the last run;
 *   when the last run was, and with which model;
 *   which model reviews it: the owner's "Triage review" model from Models by
 *     feature. A review budget above 0 with no model answers `model_required`
 *     (the dialog opens the model picker); budget 0 needs no model at all;
 *   whether anything is BLOCKING a run right now.
 *
 * Guarded by `requireProjectOwner`, which ignores the log-only ACCESS_ENFORCE=0
 * mode, for the same reason the mute routes do. The logic lives in
 * `lib/triage/preflight.ts`, shared with MCP `get_triage_status`.
