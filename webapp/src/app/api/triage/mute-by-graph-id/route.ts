/**
 * POST /api/triage/mute-by-graph-id - `/api/triage/mute` for a node known only
 * by its graph id.
 *
 * Body: { projectId, graphId }
 *
 * The graph tables carry Neo4j's internal id per row (the Node ID column), but
 * a mute is keyed on the finding's stored id, which survives the DETACH DELETE
 * and recreate of an import or a version activation. This resolves the one to
 * the other inside the caller's tenant, then issues exactly the mute the
 * Priority Board does.
 *
 * An internal id is reused after its node is deleted, so a row loaded before an
 * activation can point at a different node now. What still holds: the lookup
 * is tenant-scoped, only finding labels resolve, and the result is one
 * reversible mute. A node that is gone answers 409, the same "changed while the
 * page was open" the Priority Board handles. An already-muted node is left as it
 * was (`already: true`), and a version activation in progress answers 409 too.
