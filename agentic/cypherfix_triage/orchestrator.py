    THE SHAPE THAT MATTERS. Steps A to D happen entirely in memory; Step E is
    the only thing that writes findings. That is what makes a run safe to
    stop, safe to refuse and safe to run beside a scan: until the publish is
    claimed, the previous ranking is still what an operator sees, and a run
    that is stopped before it has changed no finding at all. (Step A does
    refresh the shared `:CVE` intelligence cache.)

      [R] authorize   ask the webapp for a run, before reading anything
      [A] score       fact sets + one row per finding -> the BASE layer (no LLM)
          layers      read each finding's stored review and decision
      [B] group       findings that share a fix (deterministic keys)
      [C] review      the LLM corrects factors against quoted evidence, only
                      where no still-valid review exists
          combine     base + review + decision -> the final values
      [D] remediate   one remediation per group, groups from the final values
      [E] publish     claim, write the layers in batches, upsert, finish

    A run never writes a decision, and never replaces a still-valid review an
    external agent wrote. The publish re-reads both under the node lock, so a
    verdict or a review given while the run works is honoured.
