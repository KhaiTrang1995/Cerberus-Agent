"""The RoE parse endpoint must resolve an LLM without a project loaded.

The bug this pins, found by driving the real feature end to end:

The endpoint read `USER_LLM_PROVIDERS` out of the orchestrator's loaded PROJECT
settings. But a RoE document is uploaded while a project is being CREATED - that
is the only place the UI offers the upload - so there is no project, and on a
freshly started agent no project has ever been loaded. The provider list was
empty, no API key resolved, and `setup_llm` raised. Every parse answered 503 for
every model, with two working providers configured in the database.

It looked like a model-routing problem and was not. It was an endpoint reading
its credentials out of a scope it does not have.

The endpoint now builds through the shared "Models by feature" builder, which
ALWAYS fetches the caller's own providers: a loaded project cannot lend its
owner's keys to someone else's parse, and no loaded project is no longer fatal.
