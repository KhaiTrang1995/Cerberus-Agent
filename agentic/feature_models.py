"""The per-user model each AI feature runs on ("Models by feature").

Mirror of the webapp registry `webapp/src/lib/llmFeatures.ts`. The value lives
in `UserSettings.featureModels`, a JSON object keyed by these ids, and is read
from the settings of the user the feature runs FOR: the effective user for a
browser-started feature, the project owner for triage and CodeFix. It is never
taken from a request body, so a client cannot pick a model the user never chose.

A feature with no model has none: there is no fallback to the project's agent
model, the agent's shared LLM or a default id, because each of those can belong
to another user or name a provider this user has no key for.
