    is correct there and wrong here, because RedAmon scans internal estates on
    purpose (Single Domain advertises "public or internal (incl. AD)"). Dropping
    every private address would silently break those engagements.

    What is left is the set that is wrong for a SCANNER no matter whose estate
    it is:

    - loopback: the name points at the recon container itself, so scanning it
      means scanning ourselves. `localhost.<domain> -> 127.0.0.1` is a real and
      common record; vulnweb.com publishes one.
    - link-local: includes 169.254.169.254, i.e. cloud metadata.
    - unspecified / multicast: not a host.

    Private and CGNAT addresses are deliberately KEPT and logged by the caller,
    so an operator can see a discovered name pointing inward without the scan
    quietly deciding for them.
