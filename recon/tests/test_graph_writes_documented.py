"""The catalog must describe every edge the CODE can write.

The live-graph oracle in test_schema_catalog.py can only see what this
deployment happened to scan. A relationship belonging to a feature nobody ran
here is invisible to it, which is a large blind spot: most deployments run a
fraction of the eleven scanners.

This checks the other direction, against the code, and is fully hermetic - no
database, so unlike the live oracle it actually runs in CI.

It found five undocumented relationship types on its first run (HAS_IP,
DISCOVERED_FROM and the three ChainFinding FINDING_AFFECTS_* edges), plus a real
bug that had nothing to do with documentation: see the phantom test below.
